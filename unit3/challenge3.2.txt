"""
Implement a function called sort_students that takes a list of student objects as input and sorts the list based on their CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) in descending order.
Each student object has the following attributes: name (string), roll_number (string), and cgpa (float).
Test the function with different input lists of students.
